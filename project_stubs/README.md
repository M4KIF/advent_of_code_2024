# What project stubs???
- Something similiar to the way coding platforms work, you just jump in and write the neccessary code,
because someone provided you the boilerplate. 
As I love to complicate simple things, ie. doing the algorithm all in main, I've made ones for myself.

# How to use It?
- Copy selected language and rename It to your preffered code source dir name.
